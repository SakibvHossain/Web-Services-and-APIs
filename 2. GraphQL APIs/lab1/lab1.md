# Lab 1 (GraphQL)

### Hibernate Query Language (HQL)
HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is primarily used for querying and manipulating data in relational databases. It is specific to the Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework and allows you to work with objects and their relationships, abstracting away the low-level details of SQL queries.

### GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs, which means it is used to request and retrieve data from APIs. It is not tied to any specific database or ORM framework. GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what data they need and retrieve that data in a single request, eliminating over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

### Fun Fact (HQL  & GraphQL)
**HQL** is focused on querying and manipulating data in a database, **GraphQL** is focused on retrieving data from APIs. GraphQL can be used with various backend technologies and data sources, including databases, microservices, and other APIs.

So, in summary, HQL is specific to the Hibernate ORM framework and is used for querying and manipulating data in relational databases. GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language for APIs and is used to request and retrieve data from APIs, regardless of the underlying data source.
