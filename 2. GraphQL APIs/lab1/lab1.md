# Lab 1 (GraphQL)

### Hibernate Query Language (HQL)
HQL (Hibernate Query Language) is primarily used for querying and manipulating data in relational databases. It is specific to the Hibernate ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework and allows you to work with objects and their relationships, abstracting away the low-level details of SQL queries.

### GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs, which means it is used to request and retrieve data from APIs. It is not tied to any specific database or ORM framework. GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what data they need and retrieve that data in a single request, eliminating over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

### Fun Fact (HQL  & GraphQL)
**HQL** is focused on querying and manipulating data in a database, **GraphQL** is focused on retrieving data from APIs. GraphQL can be used with various backend technologies and data sources, including databases, microservices, and other APIs.

So, in summary, HQL is specific to the Hibernate ORM framework and is used for querying and manipulating data in relational databases. GraphQL, on the other hand, is a query language for APIs and is used to request and retrieve data from APIs, regardless of the underlying data source.

### What we will learn on GraphQL lecture
* Overview of graphQL and the Schema
* Build graphQL server that exposes APIs to create, read, update & delete
* Learn about resolver, queries, mutators and how to handle errors.
* We will wrap up with graphiql a web application that allows to execute queries, mutations against a GraphQL Server.

### Why we need to learn GraphQL
REST is most popular way to expose data from the server
Response (returned from a REST Api is very rigidকঠোর or অনমনীয়) and returns all of the
data points as designed by the developer whether you need them or not.

that's for we need GraphQL because it offers greater flexibility

### When you need to change your recent commit which has been pushed.
1. `git commit --amend -m "refactor: Anything"`
2. `git push --force origin <branch>`
