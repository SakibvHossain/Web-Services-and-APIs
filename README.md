## Consuming SOAP & REST
Enable the consumption of SOAP and REST APIs within own API to further speed up development time and avoid reinventing the wheel.

## Documentation
Learning about the importance of documentation and easily implement it with the use of Swagger within the code.

## Unit & Integration Tests
Building unit and integration tests to gain confidence on application continues to work as intended after making new changes to the code.
